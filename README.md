How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software involves reaching small, achievable benchmarks. It is impossible to learn all that computer science has to offer, but by making small incremental progress, I am able to add to my skill set and understanding.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I used small changes to eventually code and render my 3D scene. This was wholey new to me so it took much time and effort to master these concepts.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal is to become a developer in the future. I love the idea of building something that can enhance people's lives making their life easier or fulfilling.
